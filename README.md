# 🌐 Map of Internet 

## Description
Explore the vast web of interconnected domains with Map of Internet! This project leverages asynchronous web scraping to start from a single website, extracting all linked domains, and then repeating the process for each subsequent domain. The scraped pages are saved into an Obsidian Vault using Markdown files, which include the URL, all links, and filtered domains. Visualize the intricate connections in Obsidian to gain insights into the structure of the internet.
